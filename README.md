Xenode is our game engine, designed for flexibility and performance, with development starting in August 2022 to simplify game development. 
While still in early stages, we are committed to continuous improvement and community feedback. Our goal is to create a robust framework that supports various genres and platforms, 
empowering both newcomers and seasoned developers. Join us on this exciting journey and be part of a community passionate about pushing the boundaries of game development!
